# Trees

## Overview

A tree is a data structure wherein elements are linked to one another such that all links can lead back to a single source. When represented visually, it can resemble an upside-down tree, hence the name. Unlike the other two data structures we have looked at thus far, there are several kinds of trees.

To understand the basic structure of trees, let's look at the smallest example of one:

![tree root](images/tree_root_2.png)

This tree contains only a single element: the number 10. In this case, 10 is the **root** node. This is the single source to which all elements within a tree lead back. Let's look at a bigger example.

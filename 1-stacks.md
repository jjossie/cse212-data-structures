# Stacks

## Overview

A **stack** is a simple data structure with many useful applications. They hold data in a one-dimensional array using a **last-in-first-out** (LIFO) approach. This means that elements added to the stack last will be the first to be removed. Conversely, the first element added to a stack will be removed last. In other words, the only way to remove a given element from a stack is to first remove all elements that were added after it. This concept will be explored further below. A simple way to explain stacks involves comparison to a more familiar data structure - dynamic arrays.

Stacks' operations are more restricted than dynamic arrays. While you can add values to the beginning of a dynamic array, you can only add and remove elements from the end of a stack.
